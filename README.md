# DoorLock
A smart door lock project.

Using the pybluez library for Raspberry Pi 3, the RPI3 acts as a bluetooth server to allow the establishment of a bluetooth connection with an 
Android device running the developed Android app. Once connected, the app can be uesd to control the locking and unlocking of a 'lock'.

This project is a work in progress, and is only a prototype.
